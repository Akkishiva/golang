Go Language Overview:

Compiled Language: Go is a programming language that is compiled. This means that the code you write is transformed into machine language instructions that the computer can execute directly.

Go Tool Chain: The tools that perform this transformation are collectively referred to as the Go tool chain.

Command Line Access: These tools are accessed using the go command on the command line, which includes several subcommands to perform different tasks.

Key Subcommand - run:

go run: One of the simplest and most commonly used subcommands is run.

Functionality: This command compiles the source code (files ending in .go), links it with any necessary libraries, and then executes the resulting executable file.

In summary, the go run command allows you to quickly compile and run Go programs from source files in a single step.
